# MicroC Translator

This project implements a translator for the microC language. It uses Flex for lexical analysis and Bison for parsing. The translator takes a microC source file as input and generates Three-Address Code (TAC) and Quadruple representations as output.

## Features

*   Lexical analysis using Flex ([src/a9_220101003.l](src/a9_220101003.l)).
*   Parsing using Bison ([src/a9_220101003.y](src/a9_220101003.y)).
*   Support for basic data types: `integer`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, `void`.
*   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
*   Relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`.
*   Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
*   Control flow statements: `if-else`, `for` loops.
*   Function definitions and calls.
*   Pointer support (`*` dereference, `&` address-of).
*   Basic array support (single dimension, declaration, access `[]`).
*   Symbol table management with scoping ([src/a9_220101003.cpp](src/a9_220101003.cpp)).
*   Generation of Three-Address Code (TAC) ([`print_tac`](src/a9_220101003.cpp)).
*   Generation of Quadruples ([`print_quads`](src/a9_220101003.cpp)).

## Dependencies

*   Flex (Lexical Analyzer Generator)
*   Bison (Parser Generator)
*   A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (e.g., g++)

## Building the Project

The project uses a [Makefile](Makefile) for building. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

To build the translator, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```sh
make
```

This command compiles the source files, generates the necessary parser and lexer code using Bison and Flex, and links everything into an executable named `microC_translator` located in the root directory. Intermediate files are stored in the `build/` directory.

To clean the build artifacts, run:

```sh
make clean
```

## Running the Translator
Execute the compiled translator from the command line, providing the path to a microC source file as an argument:

```sh
./microC_translator <path/to/your_file.mc>
```

For example, to translate a test file:

```sh
./microC_translator tests/test_phase4+3.mc
```

## Output
Upon successful execution, the translator generates the following files in the `output/` directory, named according to the input file:

1. `<input_filename>.lex.out`: Contains the output from the lexical analyzer, listing the sequence of tokens recognized along with their line numbers.
2. `<input_filename>.tac`: Contains the generated Three-Address Code representation of the input program.
3. `<input_filename>.quad`: Contains the generated Quadruple representation of the input program.

## Project Structure
1. `src/`: Contains the source files for the lexer (src/a9_220101003.l), parser (src/a9_220101003.y), core logic (src/a9_220101003.cpp), and header definitions (src/a9_220101003.h).
2. `build/`: Stores intermediate object files and the C++ code generated by Flex and Bison during compilation. This directory is ignored by Git (see .gitignore).
3. `output/`: The default directory where the translator writes the .lex.out, .tac, and .quad files.
4. `tests/`: Contains sample microC source files for testing the translator.
5. `Makefile`: Defines the rules for building the project.
6. `microC_translator`: The executable file generated after running make.
